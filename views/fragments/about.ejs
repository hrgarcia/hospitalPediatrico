                        Protect yourself and others by wearing masks and
                        washing hands frequently. Outdoor is safer than
                        indoor for gatherings or holding events. People
                        who get sick with Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
                        will experience mild to moderate symptoms and
                        recover without special treatments.
